Place native ad SDKs in this folder.  Currently, MoPub Android only supports Google AdSense.  If you plan on using AdSense, place the GoogleAdView.jar file here since Google does not allow us to redistribute the SDK at this time.

If you are not planning on using AdSense, you should remove com.mopub.mobileads.adapters.AdSenseAdapter from your build files to avoid errors.
